## Technologies Used
*Clever Girl* was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.  
The jQuery 3.3.1 library was used to simplify the JavaScript code where possible.  
The Bootstrap 4.1.2 library was used for the homepage to assist with the pages formatting.

## The Build
*Clever Girl* was built over two sprints and managed using Trello.

#### Sprint Two
The primary objective was to hit MVP (minimum viable product). This required there to be a fully working game with instructions, a message to display the final score, aesthetically pleasing styling, and to be hosted online.  

#### Sprint Two
This allowed for further content to be added, primarily in functionality and styling. For *Clever Girl*, this involved audio and additional characters to appear including bonus, higher point scoring, dinosaurs.
